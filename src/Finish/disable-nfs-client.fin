# This script prevents the Networked File System (NFS) client service from 
# starting.  Note that this script also installs a new run-control
# script (/etc/rc2.d/S73swapadd) to replace functionality that would
# otherwise be disabled - thereby ensuring that local swap files will be
# added at boot time.
