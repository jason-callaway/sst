# This script prevents the SYSLOG service from accepting remote log
# messages.  This is done prior to Solaris 9 by adding the "-t" to
# the 'syslogd' command line.  In Solaris 9+, this is accomplished
# by setting the LOG_FROM_REMOTE variable to 'NO' in the
# /etc/default/syslogd file.
#
# Note that this script prevents the daemon from listening on UDP
# port 514.  This is useful for systems use SYSLOG services but do
# not need to receive SYSLOG messages from other remote systems.
