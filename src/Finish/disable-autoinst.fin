# This script prevents the system from being re-installed by disabling the 
# run-control scripts associated with automatic configuration.  These scripts
# are only used if the /etc/.UNCONFIGURED or /AUTOINSTALL files are created.
# After initial installation/configuration, there is generally little
# reason for these scripts to remain available.
#
# Do not use this script if there may be a need to use the functionality 
# provided by the 'sys-unconfig' (1M) program.
