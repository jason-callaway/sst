#
# This script prevents the CDE Calendar Manager service from listening
# for remote connections.  When it cannot be made to only listen to local
# connections, it is instead disabled.
#
# This script will only attempt to disable the SMF version of the calendar
# manager, 
#   svc:/network/rpc/cde-calendar-manager:default, 
#   svc:/network/rpc/cde-calendar-manager:udp (used only in some versions of
# Solaris Express), and 
#   svc:/network/rpc-100068_2-5/rpc_udp:default (an inetd
# converted FMRI).  This script will not attempt to disable inetd entries for
# the calendar manager that would be present on Solaris OE versions prior to
# 5.10.  Instead, use the update-inetd-conf.fin script with JASS_SVCS_DISABLE
# to disable those versions.
#
# Note: Because the default JASS_SVCS_DISABLE includes the Calendar Manager,
# Uesrs should use a custom version of this variable, or override this setting
# by using JASS_SVCS_ENABLE.  Otherwise, the update-inetd.fin script will
# disable the calendar manager.
