# This script prevents the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) service 
# from starting.  
#
# Note that if JASS_DISABLE_MODE is set to "conf", the "kdc.conf" file will 
# be disabled thus impacting the ability to act as a Kerberos client.  This 
# script should not be used in that manner if the system must act as a Kerberos
# client.  This only applies on Solaris 9, as smf is used to disable the
# kdc service on Solaris 10.
