# This script configured the Internet Services Daemon (INETD) to log
# all incoming connections.  That is, a log entry will be made via
# SYSLOG if a connection is made to any service for which the INETD
# daemon is listening.  Prior to Solaris 9, this was done by adding
# the '-t' option to the 'inetd' command line.  In Solaris 9, this
# is accomplished by setting the ENABLE_CONNECTION_LOGGING variable
# in /etc/default/inetd to 'YES'.
