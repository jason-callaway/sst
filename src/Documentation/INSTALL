This is the INSTALL guide for the Sun (tm) Security Toolkit (JASS).

The source to the Toolkit can be found at:

http://www.sun.com/security/jass/

Please always install the latest version.

This document is based on the Sun Security Toolkit: Legacy Version version 4.2
alpha release.  For information on Sun Security Toolkit: Legacy Version
documentation, please refer to the README file contained in the
distribution.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
RUNNING JASS FROM THE COMMAND LINE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If JASS is being run from the command line (in standalone mode), the following 
command should be used.  This command will allow a user to run a specific 
JASS Driver from a shell prompt.

   ~/bin/jass-execute -d secure.driver

To undo a Toolkit run, the following command should be run:

   ~/bin/jass-execute -u

To audit a Toolkit run, use the command:

   ~/bin/jass-execute -a secure.driver 

For information on this script and its options, use the command:

   ~/bin/jass-execute -h

Before issuing these commands, be sure to take the time to review the 
~/Drivers/finish.init and ~/Drivers/user.init files for the various 
variables that can be set to alter default behavior. However, JASS can be
run without changing any of these variables.  For more information on audit
mode usage, please see the audit section below.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
RUNNING JASS FROM JUMPSTART
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If JASS is installed using JumpStart, then the following
configuration changes might be required to move the Toolkit 
to a new site.

   ~/Drivers/user.init

      The following variables should be defined in this file:
 
      JASS_PACKAGE_MOUNT
      JASS_PATCH_MOUNT

      These variables should be altered to use the IP address of
      the JumpStart server and the full path name to specific
      Package and Patch directories.

      If JASS is not being installed at the JumpStart root of
      ${SI_CONFIG_DIR}, then the JASS_HOME_DIR should also
      be defined using the path name to the JASS code base 
      (as a suffix from ${SI_CONFIG_DIR}).  For more information,
      refer to the ~/Drivers/user.init file.

      Using the IP addresses in these variables is not strictly
      required, but it does avoid problems when no naming service
      is available for the JumpStart client.

   ~/bin/add-client,  ~/bin/rm-client

      The add-client and rm-client scripts are distributed with the
      toolkit to provide a wrapper around the standard JumpStart
      utilities "add_install_client" and "rm_install_client".  The
      goal of these wrappers is to make the installation and 
      removal of JumpStart clients easier.

The following configuration requirements are for the JumpStart portion of 
the installation. Please refer to the Sun BluePrint OnLine article
'Building a JumpStart Infrastructure' in the Documentation directory 
for more information on JumpStart. The following are frequently 
encountered errors:

   NFS - as part of the JumpStart server's configuration make sure that 
      the required directories are being exported so that the Toolkit 
      can mount them when necessary.

   rules and rules.ok - a sample rules file is included with the Toolkit 
       (called rules.SAMPLE).  Be sure to properly configure a valid 
       ~/rules file and validate it using the JumpStart "check" program.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
RUNNING JASS IN AUDIT MODE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When running JASS in audit mode, the '-a' option to ~/bin/jass-execute should
be used.  This mode takes as an argument the name of the driver script to
audit (similar to '-d' option for application of a profile).  JASS will
then process the driver script but instead of making changes to the system,
it will attempt to audit that the changes it would have made are already
present in the system.

The behavior of JASS in audit mode can be changes using the following 
configuration parameters:

   - Check Behavior

     JASS_CHECK_MINIMIZED.  This parameter is by default set to '0'
     (disabled).  When set to '1', JASS will attempt to determine if
     packages exist on the systems for those disable-*.vfy scripts that use
     the check_minimized() function.  This check is most useful on 
     minimized systems where it is expected that those packages do not exist.

   - Display Behavior

     JASS_VERBOSITY.  This parameter controls how JASS will display its
     output.  This parameter can take one of several values as defined below:

        4	- Debug, multi-line logging with debug messages (logDebug)
        3	- Full, multi-line logging with script banners.
        2	- Brief, single-line logging per check per audit script.
        1	- Consolidated, single-line result per audit script.
        0       - Final, single-line result for entire run.

     The default verbosity mode used by JASS is 3.

     JASS_DISPLAY_TIMESTAMP.  This parameter is by default undefined (or set
     to '0').  When set in this manner, JASS will not display timestamp data
     when run with JASS_VERBOSITY <= 2 (single-line output).  To enable the
     display of timestamps, set this parameter to '1'.

     JASS_DISPLAY_HOSTNAME.  This parameter is by default undefined (or set
     to '0').  When set in this manner, JASS will not display hostname data
     when run with JASS_VERBOSITY <= 2 (single-line output).  To enable the
     display of the hostname, set this parameter to '1'.

     JASS_DISPLAY_SCRIPTNAME.  This parameter is by default undefined (or set
     to '0').  When set in this manner, JASS will not display the script name
     (being run) when run with JASS_VERBOSITY <= 2 (single-line output).  To
     enable the display of the name of the current script, set this parameter
     to '1'.

   - Logging Behavior

     All of the following parameters are configured to display their
     respective messages.  Any of these parameters can be disabled by setting
     its value to '0'.

     JASS_LOG_BANNER.      Controls logging of banners.
     JASS_LOG_FAILURE.     Controls logging of failure messages ([FAIL]).
     JASS_LOG_NOTICE.      Controls logging of notice messages ([NOTE]).
     JASS_LOG_SUCCESS.     Controls logging of success messages ([PASS]).
     JASS_LOG_SUMMARY.     Controls logging of summary messages ([SUMMARY]).
     JASS_LOG_WARNING.     Controls logging of warning messages ([WARN]).
