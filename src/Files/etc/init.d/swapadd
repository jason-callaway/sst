# This script is added by the Sun Security Toolkit: Legacy Version Finish script:
# disable-nfs-client.fin.  This is done to ensure that swap files
# defined in /etc/vfstab are added on system boot.  This script has
# been added to replace functionality typically implemented by 
# /etc/rc2/S73nfs.client (which has been disabled by the Toolkit
# Finish script, disable-nfs-client.fin).
