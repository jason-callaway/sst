# This file is supplied as part of the Sun Security Toolkit: Legacy Version and

# on individual site needs.

# to load/reload rules use /usr/sbin/ipf -Fa -f /etc/ipf/ipf.conf

block in log proto tcp from any to any
block in log proto udp from any to any

# allow connections originating from local machine out
pass out quick proto tcp from any to any flags S/SA keep state
pass out quick proto udp from any to any keep state

# allow ssh (port 22)
#  (these ip-addresses are also protected by tcp-wrappers)
#  (if you change it here, you also need to change /etc/hosts.allow)
pass in quick proto tcp from any to any port = 22

# If you are using NIS as your name service, you will need to
# allow name resolution to pass through your firewall. This is
# not possible with only ipf.conf, since NIS is an rpc service
# without a fixed port.  Instead, use the proxy in ipnat to
# redirect rpc traffic, with rules like
# map eri0 0/0 -> 192.1.1.1/32 proxy port 111 rpcbu/udp
# in file /etc/ipf/ipnat.conf (replace "eri0" with your network adapter
# instance and "192.1.1.1" with the adapter's IP address, both from
# "ifconfig -a").
