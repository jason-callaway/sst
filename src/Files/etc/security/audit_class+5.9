# User Level Class Masks
#
# Developers: If you change this file you must also edit audit.h.
#
# "Meta-classes" can be created; these are supersets composed of multiple base
# classes, and thus will have more than 1 bit in its mask. See "ad", "all",
# "am", and "pc" below for examples.
#
# The "no" (invalid) class below is commonly (but not exclusively) used in
# audit_event for obsolete events.
