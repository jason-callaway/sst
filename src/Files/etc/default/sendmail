#  This configuration file defines sendmail operating modes, queue
#  intervals, and any additional options.  Install this configuration
#  file to affect changes to sendmail operations.  For further

#
#  The latest version of this configuration file is available for the 
#  Blueprints OnLine tools area at:
#
#	http://www.sun.com/blueprints/tools/
#
#  This configuration file only works for the Solaris 8 Operating
#  Environment release.
#
# INSTALLATION
#
#	# cp <file> /etc/default/sendmail
#	# chmod 644 /etc/default/sendmail
#	# chown root:sys /etc/default/sendmail
#

#
# MODE
#
# This variable defines the mode in which sendmail will operate.  Only
# the background mode ("-bd") and the queue mode ("") make sense in
# this context.  sendmail will listen for SMTP connections and process
# queued mail in background mode.  In queue mode, it will ONLY process 
# queued mail.
# The default mode is "-bd" if this variable is not defined.
#
MODE=""

#
# QUEUEUINTERVAL
#
# The queue interval defines how long sendmail waits before attempting
# to process any mail in the queue.  Use the following characters to
# define the time:
#
#	's' senconds
#	'm' minutes
#	'h' hours
#	'd' days
#	'w' weeks
#
# For example:
#	"15m" == 15 minutes
#	"1h"  == 1 hour
#	"3d"  == 3 days
#	
# The default queue interval is "15m" (15 minutes) if this variable is
# not defined.
#
QUEUEINTERVAL="15m"

#
# OPTIONS
#
# This variable defines any additional options to sendmail.
# There is no default value for this variable.
