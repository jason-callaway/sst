#
# This script is described in the February, 2003 BluePrint article called:
#
#      Securing the Sun Cluster 3.x Software
#
# and should be used to harden Sun Cluster 3.x nodes when deploying agents in
# secured environments.
#
# The article may be found online at:
#
#     http://www.sun.com/security/blueprints
#        or
#     http://www.sun.com/blueprints/browsesubject.html#security
#
# The purpose of this driver is to implement the Solaris Operating System
# hardening recommendations that are documented in the Sun BluePrints OnLine
# articles (Solaris Operating Environment Security and Solaris OE Network
# Settings for Security).

# Note: install-strong-permissions.fin, install-fix-modes.fin, and
# enable-bart.fin are generally always the last Finish scripts to run
# as their effects could be undone by Finish scripts that would follow them.
# The install-fix-modes.fin script is generally run first.  If additional
# tightening is required, install-strong-permissions.fin can be used.  The
# enable-bart.fin script captures the state of the filesystem in a manifest.
#
# Note: install-security-mode.fin is not included in the script list
# since it requires manual intervention.  For more information, refer
# to the script source code.
#
# Note: print-rhosts.fin is not included in the script list as it takes
# several seconds to complete.  Enable to detect .rhosts or hosts.equiv
# files.
#
# Note: enable-ipfilter.fin is not included in the script list
# since Sun Cluster configurations do not support filtering with
# Solaris IP Filter. (Source: "Solaris IP Filter" chapter of the
# Solaris "System Administration Guide")
