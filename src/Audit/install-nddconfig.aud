Rationale for Verification Check:

   The purpose of this script is to determine if the 'nddconfig' run-control
   script files specified by the Sun BluePrint article, Solaris OE Network
   Settings for Security, and included with the Sun Security Toolkit: Legacy Version
   have been copied to and their settings made active on the target system.

   This script will perform two checks per object: (1) a test to ensure that
   the source and target file types match (regular file, symbolic link, or
   directory) and (2) a test to ensure that their contents are the same.

   In addition, this script will also verify that the settings defined by
   the 'nddconfig' script are actually in place on the running system.  Note
   that this script uses its own copy of the 'nddconfig' script (contained
   in the Sun Security Toolkit: Legacy Version) to provide more accurate reporting of
   results (especially in cases where the name of the script has changed or
   where other scripts are used to implement the same effects).

Determination of Compliance:

   This script will indicate a failure for each of the above checks that are
   found to be false.
